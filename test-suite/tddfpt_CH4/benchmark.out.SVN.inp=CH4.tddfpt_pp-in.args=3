     chi_i_j: dipole polarizability tensor  in units of e^2*a_0^2/energy

     S: oscillator strength in units of 1/energy

     S(\hbar \omega) = 2m/( 3 \pi e^2 \hbar)  \omega sum_j chi_j_j

     S(\hbar \omega) satisfies the f-sum rule:  \int_0^\infty dE S(E) = N_el 

     Functions are reported in \hbar.\omega  Energy unit is (Ry)
