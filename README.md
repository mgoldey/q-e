# External Potential Constrained Density Functional Theory (EPCDFT)

This is CDFT implemented in QE.

## Installation

Clone the repository and compile pw and pp following the normal compilation guidelines for QE. 

## Documentation

A tutorial can be found [here](http://www.nicholasbrawand.com/constrained-density-functional-theory). Documentation for CDFT in PW can be found in PW/Doc/INPUT_PW.def and the coupling code documentation is in PP/Doc/INPUT_CDFT.def

## Tests

Nightly tests of the master branch are run on UofC RCC Midway.
