THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION FOR INTERNAL USE. UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR MAY OCCUR AND YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY.

Forked from: 
QE MIRROR https://github.com/QEF/q-e
NISHIHARA's QE repo https://github.com/nisihara1/q-e (for DIIS)

Features in development version:
  * Inverse participation ratios and printing of wavefunction centers (Matthew Goldey)
  * Radial density of state plotting now available (Matthew Goldey, Marton Voeroes, and Federico Giberti)
  * Constrained DFT with gradients (Matthew Goldey, Nicholas Brawand, and Marton Voeroes)
  * Geometry optimization with SR1-BFGS (Satomichi Nishihara)
  * NEB optimization  with L-BFGS and L-SR1 (Satomichi Nishihara)
  * RMM-DIIS diagonalization to solve KS-equation (Satomichi Nishihara)

Test files are gathered in this repository (https://github.com/mgoldey/qe_test_cases) which should be checked out inside of this developmental version.
